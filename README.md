# InsidePaint
An immersive experience into Vincent Van Gogh's famous paintings. 

Inside Paintings leverages telepresence, and takes users to the artistic world of Vincent Van Gogh. Step into the vivid colors straight from his palette, appreciate his iconic work in three dimensions, and walk around the chair he painted in his bedroom. When night falls, we enter Vincentâ€™s dream to visualize, then paint his most valuable work The Starry Night.

It is one of the four Virtual Reality course projects, and is written in Unity C#.
